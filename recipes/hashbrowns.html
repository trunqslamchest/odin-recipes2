        <img src="../images/hashbrown.jpg">
        <h2>Getta forkfulla this goodness.</h2>
            <p>These classic diner-style hash browns are crispy on the outside and 
                fluffy on the inside.</p>
        <h3>What you'll need:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 russet potatoes, peeled</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons clarified butter</li>
                <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
                <li>1 pinch paprika, or to taste</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Now put it all together...</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Shred potatoes into a large bowl filled with cold water. Stir 
                    until water is cloudy, drain, and cover potatoes again with fresh 
                    cold water. Stir again to dissolve excess starch. Drain potatoes 
                    well, pat dry with paper towels, and squeeze out any excess 
                    moisture.</li>
                <li>Heat clarified butter in a large non-stick pan over medium heat. 
                    Sprinkle shredded potatoes into the hot butter and season with 
                    salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and paprika.</li>
                <li>Cook potatoes until a brown crust forms on the bottom, about 5 
                    minutes. Continue to cook and stir until potatoes are browned 
                    all over, about 5 more minutes.</li>
            </ol>
